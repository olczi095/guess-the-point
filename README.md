# guess-the-point
A simple game in which the user must type the point falls in the rectangle.

## General rules
1. At first the program shows coordinates of the rectangle to the user (they are randomly selected), then the user has to guess the point from inside the rectangle by enter the coordinates of the point.
2. The coordinates of the points can be randomized (and guessing) from the range 0-100.

## Inspired by
The game idea comes from the [Advanced Python Programming: Build 10 OOP Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-pro-course/) course on the UDEMY website.
I wrote it myself from scratch before checking the code from the course, mainly to practice OOP. 

## Libraries and Technologies 
Python 3.11.0
